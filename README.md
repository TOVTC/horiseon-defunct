Horiseon is a marketing agency.

##About This Repository
This repository hosts an accessible version of the Horiseon website code, specifically to address semantic HTML tags, image alt text, code comments, and CSS style streamlining.

(Note: for the assignment, I would have split my original Git commit in two, so that "initial updates to HTML and style" would be "alt text and section comments edited in HTML" and then "CSS styles conslidated into main" with a third commit to add the README)

##Installation and Usage
Installation should at minimum include an index.html file and an "assets" folder containing a style.css file and seven images (four .jpg files and three .png files) in the "css" and "images" folders respectively.

# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website. Accessible websites are better optimized for search engines, and help companies avoid litigation.

For this week's Challenge, your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. It's important to follow the Scout Rule when working with an existing codebase: Always leave the code a little cleaner than you found it. 

To impress the imaginary client for this Challenge, you should go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long-term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, such as by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Remember when working with a client, it is essential to read the acceptance criteria for guidance and clarity on what the client expects, especially when asked to make a judgment call, such as when an icon needs an accessible alt tag and when it is okay to leave it blank. 

To successfully complete this week's Challenge, all acceptance criteria must be fully addressed!
