# Horiseon
Horiseon is a marketing agency.

## About This Repository
This repository hosts an accessible version of the Horiseon website code, specifically to address semantic HTML tags, image alt text, code comments, and CSS style streamlining.

The website can be found here: [Horiseon](https://tovtc.github.io/horiseon-scscbc/)

(Note: for the assignment, I would have split my original Git commit in two, so that "initial updates to HTML and style" would be "alt text and section comments edited in HTML" and then "CSS styles conslidated into main" with a third commit to add the README)

## Installation and Usage
Installation should at minimum include an index.html file and an "assets" folder containing a style.css file and seven images (four .jpg files and three .png files) in the "css" and "images" folders respectively.
